_Week 21 (22–28 May 2023)_

Sicily week 1 with I and B. Road trip from Palermo to Noto to the Etna and back to Palermo. Some memories and thoughts in a kind of chronological order:

### Palermo

- cornetto with pistachio cream! First one at U Cafè Sicilianu
- Zisa castle was so underwhelming that it became a joke for the rest of the week
- on some square a man sings: ya me ya me ya peya peya, ya me ya me ya peya peya pouli pouli pouli poula pouli pouli pouli poulaaaaaaya peya peya pouli pouli pouli poula
- gelato at Cappadonia, one of the best in Italy according to [Gambero Rosso, the Michelin guide of gelato](gamberorosso.it/gelaterie/)
- 1000 types of pasta on offer at a small supermarket
- it's arancina not arancino, says our food tour guide. Although someone from Catania and someone from Palermo could spend hours arguing about it. Rationale: the Palermitan recipe (saffron rice, no tomatoes), not the Catanian (no saffron, ragu), is the original because there were no tomatoes before the Colombian exchange. So: arancina is feminine
- spleen sandwich (pani ca meusa) married (with cheese) or single (without cheese). Surprisingly good, went for a second one the next day for breakfast
- other street food: panelle crocchè sfincione cassata and the spring onion wrapped in bacon
- buzz cut at a local barber, guy next to me in a tight t-shirt is getting his shoulder-length, blonde-dyed hair curled while speaking on the phone
- great caffè and cornetto at Bar Vabres
- botanical garden: super nice! Really big ficus. They say it's the biggest in Europe (there was a bigger one on a square downtown until someone crashed their car into it and now it's smaller)
- last panelle e crocchè at Chiluzzo
- driving rules (speed limits, number of lanes, places where it's allowed to park) are more like suggestions
- Italo Classic Spotify playlist in the car!
- autostrada stops have great coffee

### Syracuse Coast

- the guy who's supposed to open the house we rented tells us to meet him in 7 minutes (and arrives 15 minutes after that)
- biting into raw lemons from the garden, discovering the nespolo
- at the SiPiù supermarket I find the amaro Amara that I'd read about, plus about 5 other types of craft Sicilian amari. The Campari is on the lower shelf
- the black olive tapenade I get turns out to be vino cotto
- Nero d'Avola!
- first granita in Marzamemi at the bar caffè Al Ciclope 2 (because granita is an East Sicily thing), difference between a granita and a cremolata
- swallows nesting in Marzamemi backstreets, cacti growing on walls and roofs
- camera della morte of the ancient tuna fishing place
- white wine in Noto, smells like apricot
- granita+caffè at Cafè Sicilia in front of the Baroque cathedral
- Amara spritz on the roof terrace and barbecue at the house, salsiccia eggplant zucchini, vino cotto sauce improvised by Clara
- ...

### Etna
