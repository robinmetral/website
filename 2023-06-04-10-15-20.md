_Week 21 (22–28 May 2023)_

Sicily week 1 with I and B. Road trip from Palermo to Noto to the Etna and back to Palermo. Some memories and thoughts in a kind of chronological order:

### Palermo

- I and B met us at the train station on Sunday night, randomly grabbed a panino panelle on the way to the Airbnb
- cornetto with pistachio cream!
- Zisa castle was so underwhelming that it became a joke for the rest of the week
- on some square a man sings ya peya peya pouli pouli pouli poula
- gelato at Cappadonia, one of the best in Italy according to [Gambero Rosso, the Michelin guide of gelato](gamberorosso.it/gelaterie/)
- it's arancina not arancino, says our food tour guide. Although someone from Catania and someone from Palermo could spend hours arguing about it. Rationale: the Palermitan recipe (saffron rice, no tomatoes), not the Catanian (no saffron, ragu), is the original because there were no tomatoes before the Colombian exchange. So: arancina is feminine
- spleen sandwich (pani ca meusa) married (with cheese) or single (without cheese). Surprisingly good, went for a second one the next day for breakfast
- other street food: panelle crocchè sfincione cassata
- buzz cut at a local barber, guy next to me in a tight t-shirt is getting his shoulder-length, blonde-dyed hair curled while speaking on the phone
- super nice espresso at X
- botanical garden: super nice! Really big ficus (claimed to be the biggest in Europe). There was a bigger one on a square downtown until someone crashed their car into it and now it's smaller

## Watching

Nothing!

## Reading

Nothing either! (Not counting a bunch of blog posts about the places we were visiting.)
