Woken up at 5 by a mosquito in the room couldn't swat it

Out by 6 in search of coffee

Empty streets, just me and a couple old men on benches where they'll sit all day

The fish shop is the only thing that's open

By the Temo river

Sun rising behind the castle hill

Hundreds (thousands?) of swallows hunting above the waters

Wouldn't want to be a mosquito
