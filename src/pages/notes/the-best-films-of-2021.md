The 2021 video countdown is out!

Every year, Indiewire film critic [David Ehrlich](https://twitter.com/davidehrlich) compiles his 25 favorite films of the year into a video countdown, that he releases on his [Vimeo channel](https://vimeo.com/user92154201).

I'm not sure if that qualifies as a film award, but if it does it's hands down my favorite (and definitely the most cinematic).

Here's the full film list:[^1]

<li><em>West Side Story</em> (Steven Spielberg)</li>
<li><em>The Green Knight</em> (David Lowery)</li>
<li><em>Undine</em> (Christian Petzold)</li>
<li><em>All Light, Everywhere</em> (Theo Anthony)</li>
<li><em>Flee</em> (Jonas Poher Rasmussen)</li>

<li><em>The Matrix Resurrections</em> (Lana Wachowski)</li>
<li><em>Procession</em> (Robert Greene)</li>
<li><em>The World to Come</em> (Mona Fastvold)</li>

<li><em>Petite Maman</em> (Céline Sciamma)</li>
<li><em>Drive My Car</em> (Ryusuke Hamaguchi)</li>
<li><em>memoria</em> (Apichatpong Weerasethakul)</li>
<li><em>The Souvenir Part II</em> (Joanna Hogg)</li>
<li><em>Bergman Island</em> (Mia Hansen-Løve)</li>
<li><em>The Power of the Dog</em> (Jane Campion)</li>
</ol>

I've seen only five of them (including _The Power of the Dog_, which totally deserves the accolade), and hadn't even heard of many on the list. In other words, I have homework!

I was surprised to not find other acclaimed releases in the top 25, like _The French Dispatch_ (Wes Anderson) or _Dune_ (Denis Villeneuve). But that also leaves more space for smaller productions, which is great!

Less known films that I'd have added to my own video countdown might have been _The Mauritanian_ (Kevin Macdonald), _Inside_ (Bo Burnham), and [_Azor_ (Andreas Fontana)](/notes/azor-by-andreas-fontana-was-good-weird).

[^1]: But do watch the video! The introduction (before the countdown itself) is my favorite part, and the entire thing is great (the film choices but also the editing, the music).
