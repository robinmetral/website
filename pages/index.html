<h1>Welcome to this website thing</h1>
<p class="mb-s">My name is Robin—hi!</p>
<p class="mb-s">
  I'm from Geneva (Switzerland not Ohio). After living in Berlin for four years,
  I recently moved to the Monts d'Ardèche region in Southeastern France, and
  live in a 200-year-old former silk worm farm that my grandparents turned into
  a home.
</p>
<p class="mb-s">
  I work as an frontend engineer (which serves as my excuse for the poor design
  of this thing), though I'm currently on a long sabbatical break. These days I
  spend my time climbing, reading, drinking wine with bread and cheese, and
  doing other things that I'm not going to list here for the sake of your time
  and mine.
</p>
<p class="mb-s">
  This thing is an old-fashioned static website with very little fluff. For now
  it has a log of films I watch in <a href="/watching/">watching</a> (edit:
  currently broken, will fix), and things I write in
  <a href="/notes/">notes</a>.
  <em
    >(NB: since moving to France, I started to write some notes in French (my
    native language, bonjour baguette). A language filter is coming soon but in
    the meantime, feel free to ignore these/use a translator, you know how this
    works.)</em

<p class="mb-m">
  Enjoy browsing, and if you want to get in touch (compliments, praise,
  applause, flattery etc.), my email is my first name @metral.ch.
