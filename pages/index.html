<h1>Welcome to this website thing</h1>
<p class="mb-s">My name is Robin—hi!</p>
<p class="mb-s">
  I was born in Geneva (Switzerland not Ohio) in the last century. After living
  in Berlin for four years, I recently moved to the Monts d'Ardèche region in
  Southeastern France, and live in a 200-year-old former silk worm farm that my
  grandparents turned into a home.
</p>
<p class="mb-s">
  I work as an frontend engineer, which pays the bills and serves as my excuse
  for the poor design of this thing. These days, when I'm not sitting at my
  company-issued laptop, I like to climb, read, drink wine with bread and
  cheese, and do a lot of other stuff that I'm not going to list here for the
  sake of your time and mine.
</p>
<p class="mb-s">
  This thing is an old-fashioned static website with very little fluff. For now
  it has things I write in <a href="/notes/">notes</a>, and a log of films I
  watched in <a href="/watching/">watching</a>.
  <em
    >(NB: since moving to France, I started to write some notes in French (my
    native language, bonjour baguette). A language filter is coming soon but in
    the meantime, feel free to ignore these/use a translator, you know how this
    works.)</em

<p class="mb-m">
  Enjoy browsing, and if you want to get in touch (compliments, praise,
  applause, flattery etc.), my email is my first name @metral.ch.
