      Hi Chris! First of, thanks for the Indieweb inspiration on boffosocko.com!
    </p>
    <p>
      Just a quick reaction here: I don't think you need to use UserWay to make
      your website accessible. At first glance I can't see any WCAG 2.0
      violation here that the overlay would fix—but maybe I'm missing something?
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, overlays can actually be harmful: I'm sure you've seen this
      already when everyone was sharing it a few months ago, but just in case
      you haven't, there's a lot of info on the
      <a href="https://overlayfactsheet.com/">Overlay Fact Sheet</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy to talk if I can help further with this, I'd love to "give back"
      somehow! Take care :)
