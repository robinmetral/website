      The Scent of Time, by Byung-Chul Han. From The Practical Polymath: "The
      book is a critique of how our culture of time-optimization and
      productivity is robbing time of its meaning or “scent” as he puts it. In
      the book, he opposes the “pilgrim” who is in transition towards his
      objective to the “tourist” who wants to get there as fast as possible. The
      former's experience is enriched by the journey that offers an opportunity
      for contemplation while the latter hops from one thing to another without
      much focus. According to the author, we are increasingly living life like
      tourists"

      The Air-Conditioned Nightmare. "In 1939, after ten years as an expatriate,
      Henry Miller returned to the United States with a keen desire to see what
      his native land was really like—to get to the roots of the American nature
      and experience. He set out on a journey that was to last three years,
      visiting many sections of the country and making friends of all
      descriptions. The Air-Conditioned Nightmare is the result of that
      odyssey."
