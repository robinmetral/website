  <h2 class="mb-s">About this thing</h2>
  <p class="mb-s">
    This is an old-fashioned static website made of HTML, CSS, and a few
    sprinkles of vanilla JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-s">
    I work with JS-heavy applications at work and didn't want to spend hours
    updating dependencies for my personal website, so I made my own small static
    site generator for this website:
    <a href="https://github.com/robinmetral/brut">brut</a> (beta, use at your
    own risk). It mostly takes care of building HTML from markdown and running
    custom build-time scripts.

  <h2 class="mb-s">Accessibility</h2>
  <p class="mb-s">
    I do my best to keep this website compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA. If you are
    experiencing any issues while browsing,
    <a href="/contact/">please reach out</a> and I'll address them asap.

  <h2 id="privacy" class="mb-s">A very short privacy policy</h2>
  <p class="mb-s">This website doesn't track you (at all).</p>
  <p>
    I do have access to data such as page views on the server but (a) the data
    is completely anonymous and (b) I don't really look at it.
