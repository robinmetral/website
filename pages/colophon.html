  <h2 class="mb-s">About this thing</h2>
  <p class="mb-s">
    This is an old-fashioned static website made of HTML, CSS, and a few
    sprinkles of vanilla JavaScript. Read on for details.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-s">
    <strong>Building</strong>: I didn't want to spend time updating npm
    dependencies for my personal website, so I made my own small static site
    generator: <a href="https://github.com/robinmetral/brut">brut</a> (forever
    in alpha, use at your own risk). It mostly takes care of building HTML from
    markdown and running custom build-time scripts.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-s">
    <strong>Hosting</strong>: the website is
    <a href="/notes/deploying-a-static-site-to-cloudflare-pages/"
      >hosted for free on Cloudflare Pages</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-s">
    <strong>Design</strong>: all colors are from your browser's default
    stylesheet, so please forward any complaints to your browser vendor. Joking
    aside, the goal here is to keep things clean and minimal, and lean into
    platform defaults as much as possible. Pages will look slightly different
    depending on which browser you're using.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-s">
    <strong>Browser support</strong>: this website supports all browsers (maybe
    not as far back as the IE days) because it works with
    <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/"
      >the web's grain</a
    >. Most things should also work without JavaScript, which I only use for
    progressive enhancement at runtime. If you run into any issues, let me know
    at robin@metral.ch, and I'll be happy to take a look.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-s">
    <strong>Sustainability</strong>: I try to keep page weight as low as
    possible by optimizing assets (especially images) and lazy-loading heavier
    images. This website also caches assets pretty liberally, to optimize repeat
    visits. In the future I'll look into hosting it on a home server (solar?)
    because let's be honest, this doesn't really need to be on Cloudflare's 275
    data centers.

  <p class="mb-s">
    I do my best to keep this website compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA. If you are
    experiencing any issues while browsing, please reach out at robin@metral.ch
    and I'll address them asap.

  <h2 class="mb-s">A very short privacy policy</h2>
  <p class="mb-s">This website doesn't track you (at all).</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Important update:</strong> I have noticed that Cloudflare, which
    generously hosts this website for free, injects its tracking beacon on this
    website, despite my opting out. I've
    <a
      href="https://community.cloudflare.com/t/cant-disable-web-analytics-for-coudflare-pages-site/761716"
      >reported</a
    >
    the bug on Cloudflare's forums, to no avail. This should go away soon, since
    I've decided to move away from Cloudflare hosting (see "Sustainability"
    above). My apologies.
