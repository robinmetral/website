Forgot to write this when we finished the season [in late October](/notes/weeknote-32-t-visiting-feeding-princesse/). Season 2 very much builds on top of season 1, developing characters and plots, and going all in with the LGBTQ+ themes. The show is still hilarious and heartwarming/cosy somehowâ€”comfort TV. [With great music](/notes/pygmy-love-song-and-other-recent-earworms/).

8/10
