[Everybody liked this musical film](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Heights_(film)#Critical_response>) when it came out in 2021. I thought it was two and a half hours of painfully cliché events and characters. The whole thing felt so fake! Granted, it's a musical, so maybe I should have expected it, but I've seen plenty and the others didn't make me feel like this, at least not to this extent.

I can't even give credits to the setting of a NYC neighborhood during a heatwave, because that's basically copied from [Do The Right Thing (1989)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_the_Right_Thing).

The only thing I liked was one surreal scene where characters dance on a building façade, this was pretty cool and I wonder how they did it—the transition from "gravity is down" to "gravity is the façade" is really smooth. (Answer: they used their $55 million budget.) That's it.

3/10
