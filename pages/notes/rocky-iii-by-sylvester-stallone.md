Continuing my Rocky watchthrough.

I found III better than [II](/notes/rocky-ii-by-sylvester-stallone/) (which felt like a remake of [the original](/notes/rocky-by-john-g-avildsen/)), but still too similar and predictable in the story ark. And somehow I don't really like the character of Rocky Balboa anymore, over the course of three films he went from a vulnerable, relatable human to more of a one-dimensional celebrity. Did Stallone?

One point for Eye of the Tiger[^1].

IV/10

[^1]: which was actually written for the film! Before the rewatch I thought I remembered that this was the song playing during the _Rocky steps_ scene in the original film, but no, the song was only released in 1982 as the theme for III (and as a single the day after the film's release).
