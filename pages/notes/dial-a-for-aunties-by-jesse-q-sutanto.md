Audiobook, borrowed via Libby. A wild ride of a book that would fall in the broad category of romance but bounces between genres: coming-of-age, immigrant story, thriller, and a cringy love story. It's light and funny and this keeps it all together. (Also narration by Risa Mei is great.)

Great listen-while-doing-something-else material.

6/10
