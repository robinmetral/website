The tagline of the [Roamin' The Empire](http://www.roamintheempire.com/) blog says it all:

> Archaeological Travels Through The Roman Empire

Now I'm not really into archaeology, but this is great!! You can't not love the level of specialization and detail. And what a wealth of information! Look at [that map of visited sites](http://www.roamintheempire.com/index.php/visits/)! It reminds me a bit of websites like [seat61](https://www.seat61.com/).

With my limited knowledge about ancient history I could only skim through the post on [the ancient settlement of Erix](http://www.roamintheempire.com/index.php/2018/01/24/eryx/) (today Erice, Sicily, that we visited last week), not fully understanding things [^1]. Guess that the kind of people who would understand+love this blog are the same that could understand+love the Neapolis archeological site near Siracusa (not me).

Still: Roamin' The Empire will henceforth be on my list of resources to check out when traveling around the Mediterranean, and maybe it should be on yours too!

[^1]: there's also one on [Genava](http://www.roamintheempire.com/index.php/2019/01/23/genava/) (Geneva, Switzerland) where I'm from, one on [Turris Lybisonis](http://www.roamintheempire.com/index.php/2020/07/29/turris-libysonis/) (Porto Torres, Sardinia) where we're heading today, and many many others
