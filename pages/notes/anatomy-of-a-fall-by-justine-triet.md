Palme d'Or at Cannes this year, caught at the Navire theater in Aubenas. It's very very good, I liked the premise (a man dies from a fall off the 4th floor window of his chalet, his wife is a suspect and tries to prove her innocence in the ensuing trial), the ambiguity of the whole thing, and the actors were all fantastic. Had me gripped from start to finish, which isn't a given for a legal procedural film.

8/10
