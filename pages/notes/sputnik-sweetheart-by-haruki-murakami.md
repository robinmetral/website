_Sputnik Sweetheart_ (1999) is a short(er) Murakami novel, about 7h in its audiobook version (borrowed via the Libby app, narrated by Adam Sims). It's magical realism (in a moderate dose) with classic Murakami themes of relationships (some cringy), loneliness, books, music, cats. It's got a sort of impossible love triangle, alternate worlds and a bit of mystery.

I liked it, but less than his other novels I think: the story of the _Trilogy of the Rat_ books[^1] grabbed me more, and I missed the pronounced magical realism of [_Hard-Boiled Wonderland_ (1985)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard-Boiled_Wonderland_and_the_End_of_the_World), [_1Q84_ (2009â€“10)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1Q84) and others. This felt a bit like a half-measure. Still, Muramaki novels are kind of comfort books to me: I read a lot of them[^2] so they feel familiar and that makes them good reads for when I'm tired (no need to think much) or when I'm gardening (yay audiobooks).

[^2]: out of [15 novels listed on Murakami's Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami#Novels), I've now read 11 (and Murakami's 15th novel, [_Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorless_Tsukuru_Tazaki_and_His_Years_of_Pilgrimage) just came out, and hasn't been translated yet.)
