Watched without C, very very good black comedy, pretty dark and very tense. Plot: Danny, a struggling construction contractor, is involved in a road rage incident with Amy, a successful but burnt out business owner. The 10-episode miniseries tells the story of their BEEF and descent into madness. I absolutely loved the characters, Steven Yeun <3. There's a comedic aspect so the plot is exaggerated but a lot of the series feels very genuine, I could see it happening, only makes it more thrilling. Soundtrack by Bobby Krlic, the composer of other A24 productions like Ari Aster's Midsommar and [Beau is Afraid](/notes/beau-is-afraid-by-ari-aster/), is a perfect mix of 90s and early 00s gems to match the characters' state of mind through the series. Perfect ending.

9/10
