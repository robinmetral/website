A divisive Wes Anderson film, that some dismissed as the director parodizing of his own style. It's true that the aesthetics are extremely[^1], almost comically, "Wes Anderson". But behind the symmetrical, pastel-colored façade of the film hides deeper meaning.

I liked the typically wesandersonian "Russian dolls" structure of a play within a show within a movie, except that this time we simultaneously see the making of the play and the play itself (unlike previous W.A. films where the framing device was more stylistic). I liked the façade itself: the photography the aesthetics the details, the directing. One thing I liked a bit less is the score—I had the Alexandre Desplat scores for The Grand Budapest Hotel and The French Dispatch on repeat for days, but country music isn't really my thing, even when Desplat makes it.

To really get it though, Anderson wants you to watch the film twice. But is there any one thing to "get"? It seems that there are multiple ways to read and understand the film, and I think that's part of its complexity/beauty. The way I see it—after a single viewing[^2] and a lot of reading online afterward[^3]—_Asteroid City_ is at its core a film about storytelling: the stories we tell ourselves and others, the way we frame them, the worldviews we build to accommodate them and what happens when they crumble.

In a single quote, maybe:

> - I still don't understand the play
> - Don't worry about it, just keep telling the story

8/10
