A beaver![^1]

6.50am, on our way to Boulderklub Kreuzberg, on the Northern bank of the Landwehrkanal in Kreuzkölln. Here he was, swimming East in the morning sunlight.

This was probably one of the 5-6 individuals that have been sighted on the Landwehrkanal lately![^2]

[^1]: At first I thought it was an otter—its head was barely out of the water and I've rarely seen one or the other. But otters are much more rare in Germany, so my bet is on beaver here.
[^2]: According to the Tagesspiegel in [Biber leben auch am Landwehrkanal](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/bezirke/das-wilde-berlin-kreuzberg-biber-leben-auch-am-landwehrkanal/26864034.html) (_Beavers also live on the Landwehrkanal_).
