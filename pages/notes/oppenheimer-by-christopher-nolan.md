Second time at the movies at Le Navire in Aubenas for this 3h biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer, "father of the atomic bomb".

It was worth a watch in the theater! Ours had Dolby 7.1 sound and things shook. Hadn't felt sound this good at a movie since _Joker_ by Todd Phillips.

The film itself was great, just like everyone else seems to be saying. Not just sound but writing, photography, acting, directing. Nolan does know how to create grandiose cinematic experiencesâ€”he doesn't deal in half-measures. It's interesting to read up on Oppenheimer after seeing the film, trying to disentangle fact from fiction. Or should I say fission?

9/10
