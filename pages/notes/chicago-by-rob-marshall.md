Wikipedia says that Chigago (2002) is a "musical black comedy crime film" and... yes? Something of a high-energy legal drama-satire with lots of dancing. Won six Oscars in 2003 including Best Picture, yet it had escaped my attention. Great energy great pacing, though characters are cringy and the plot seems completely nonsensical... until you realize it's based on [actual people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beulah_Annan) and actual events (highly dramatized, of course). The ["We Both Reached For The Gun" scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LcAUfhcFmA) is amazing.
