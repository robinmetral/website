Streamed 1955 psychological horror film _Les diaboliques_[^1] on MUBI, where Clouzot's 1942 debut _The Murderer Lives at Number 21_ is also showing (on my watchlist).

I wasn't sure what to expect—hadn't heard of it nor of Clouzot—and I loved it! That's the kind of stuff that MUBI is great for. The plot is very very good so I won't say anything about it at all, watch the film! I did love the film's ending screen, that reads:

> Don't be DIABOLICAL!  
> Do not destroy the interest that your friends may have in this movie.  
> Do not tell them what you have seen.  
> Thank you, on their behalf.

The film also inspired Hitchcock's _Psycho_, which of course makes me want to rewatch it along with the rest of Hitchcock's work.

8/10

[^1]: why has the plural been stripped from the English translation of the title?
