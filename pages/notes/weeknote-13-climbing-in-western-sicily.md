_Week 22 (29 Mayâ€“04 June 2023)_

## Bouldering at Bosco Scorace

After leaving I and B at the Palermo airport, we swapped our rental 4-people-4-bags big car for a small 2-people-2-bags Fiat Panda and took the highway towards Trapani in the West of the island.

After more than a week of not climbing we knew we'd really want to climb, so we'd booked a room for 3 nights at [Polvere di Stelle](https://bebpolveredistelle.it/), a B&B run by a couple of climbers from Milano. G and D have 5 dogs, two cats, a kitten, and a climbing wall in the garden where climbers from the area meet for a session and a drink a couple times each week.

But the reason we came is that D also opened a bouldering crag in a forest 20 minutes (or 30 minutes with a Panda, bad roads[^1]) from the B&B: Bosco Scorace.

We bought the topo and spent two mornings climbing there, renting crashpads from the B&B (two crashpads can surprisingly fit into a Panda). It was great! Amazing limestone boulders, super interesting problems, and not too warm in the sectors with more trees. Grading was pretty tough and I only managed a single 6a, but I have a lot of unfinished projects that I might get to continue working on next time!

## DWS in SVLC

After Trapani, we spent the second half of the week at the northwestern tip of the island, close to popular San Vito Lo Capo (SVLC for short).

The area has the most beautiful beaches that we've been to in Sicily (Isulidda, Tonarella dell' Uzzo), natural reserves (Lo Zingaro), and crazy weather (mountains on a peninsula. There was a huge thunderstorm, fortunately we were in the car).

It's also one of the most famous places for climbing in Sicily. Scogliera di Salinella is a huge, 5-kilometer-long, West-facing cliff right by the sea with hundreds and hundreds of sport climbing routes. Unfortunately we weren't ready for it (no gear, and our stay was a bit too last-minute to find a place to rent some[^2]) so that will have to wait for next time! Also good to know, there's a camping village right by the crag, El-Bahira (not sure if they rent gear).

We did "try" deep water soloing (DWS for short) for the first time, though. There's quotes around "try" because the crag we went to, Cala Firriato, was harder than expected, the water shallower than expected, and weather was gray/coldish so we apprehended falling more than expected. We climbed one 6a from the Rockfax topo, Techre, and would have wanted to try more but access to the bottom of the routes was a tricky 6b+ traverse, Panca Bestia, right above shallow waters. Next time we want to do DWS we'll go with someone who knows the spot for more peace of mind!

## The food section

Some foods that we tried and that you should too if you're ever in Western Sicily:

- **Busiate**, local pasta from Trapani, originally made with knitting needles and if that's how they initially got their name (was it the Greek word maybe?). A small takeout restaurant in Marsala specializes in them, it's just called Busiate
- ...eaten with **pesto alla Trapanese**, a refreshing pesto made of basil, pecorino, fresh tomatoes, almonds and optionally mint and lemon
- **Cous cous** (yes they spell it in two words), exactly what you're thinking of but the one we tried tended to be coarser than we were used to, cooked al dente (of course), and eaten with seafood (clams octopus and the like). We had our favorite at Profumi di Cous Cous in SVLC
- **Genovese**, a pastry from Erice (or at least one that's very popular and good in Erice--we've also seen it elsewhere). It's dough filled with pastry cream and coated with powdered sugar, eat it at the famous Pasticceria Maria Grammatico or the less-famous-but-just-as-tasty Pasticceria San Carlo (or both, like I did)
- not from the region specifically (rather from Palermo, or so claim Palermitans) but the **Arancine** from La Tonda in Erice are worth a special mention!
- another really good pastry that we've only seen in the area (but haven't researched where it's from yet) is the **cassatelle**, not to be confused with the famous **cassata** or marzipan-coated variant **cassatina**. It's dough filled with ricotta, shaped in a half-moon, deep fried, and it's delicious
- **Mazara red prawns**, considered a delicacy and usually eaten raw (a first for us). We had them as an antipasto at Profumi di Cous Cous and C says their head tastes sweet
- **Marsala wine**, a fortified wine that's apparently similar to Sherry (I don't know Sherry, but found it similar to Porto). In Marsala try it at La Sirena Ubriaca, if only for the friendliness of the bar owner. [According to Wine Enthusiast](https://www.winemag.com/2022/11/23/marsala-wine/), Marco De Bartoli makes [the best Marsala](https://www.marcodebartoli.com/en/wines/vecchio-samperi/) (although it's interestingly not labeled Marsala because of the _in perpetuum_ a.k.a. [Solera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solera) ageing process), so we're bringing back two bottles of that
- Marsala isn't the only good wine in the region, and we've visited a few vineyards for tastings and to bring the right kind of souvenirs back home. Mustazza, Francesco Mazara, Giacco, we just drove around and called shortly before showing up, trying to avoid the really large, tour-of-the-vineyard-only estates

## 12 hours on the Palermo-Cagliari ferry

In progress

## Watching, reading

Still nothing! Thought I might have read on the ferry but turns out 12 hours go by pretty fast when there's A around (and Uno).

I'm excited to be back home where we have our film projector, a MUBI subscription, and a library card.

[^1]: we were almost happy that the rental company forced us into getting the full insurance for the car! Never before has a Fiat Panda wandered so far off the beaten path
[^2]: G and D at Polvere di Stelle do also rent ropes, quickdraws, harnesses etc. if you're interested. SVLC is about 45 minutes drive from the B&B.
