Found at secondhand bookstore _Curious Fox_ [in Berlin](/notes/weeknote-33-berlin-brussels/). _All Systems Red_ is the first installment in the _Murderbot Diaries_ series, though completely standalone. I'm not the biggest fan of sci-fi in general but I really, really liked this: it's original and funny and a great length (160 pages, a novella). The same idea and plot could have been made into a long trilogy but instead the pacing is faster, there are hints of worldbuilding but without insisting on it too much, and before you know it there's the resolution and epilogue. Reminds me a bit of Andy Weir (_The Martian_, _Project Hail Mary_). I'd like to pick up the next diary!
