<span lang="fr">_L'exil et le Royaume_</span> (English: _Exile and the Kingdom_) is a 1957 book of stories by Albert Camus[^1].

Instead of starting at the beginning, I first heard the second part[^2] of the book's fourth story, <span lang="fr">_L'hôte_</span> (_The Guest_), which was [read aloud at a public library event](/notes/weeknote-1-first-crag-climb/) a couple of months ago. I really liked it and F liked it even more, it reminded her of her years in Algeria (she lived in Algiers during the better part of the 60s). We borrowed the book, she read it, and now I did too.

<span lang="fr">_L'hôte_</span> is actually one out of only two stories set in Algeria. Like others it's about solitude, otherness, with a healthy dose of ethics. Two other stories are set in France, one in Brazil and one in Mali, for a total of six.

My favorites were probably <span lang="fr">_L'hôte_</span> and <span lang="fr">_Jonas, ou l'artiste au travail_</span> (_Jonas or the Artist at Work_), and I liked the very last story <span lang="fr">_La pierre qui pousse_</span> (_The Growing Stone_) a bit less (didn't really understand it, I think).

It's difficult to write much more about the book in general since the stories are pretty different. [English language Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile_and_the_Kingdom) has interesting articles (though poor in sources) on each of them.

I just borrowed <span lang="fr">_L'étranger_</span> and <span lang="fr">_La peste_</span> for long-due (re-)reads.

[^1]: Camus is of course known for his 1942 <span lang="fr">_L'étranger_</span> (_The Stranger_) and 1947 <span lang="fr">_La peste_</span> (_The Plague_), of which at least one is sure to be part of any given French high school syllabus.
