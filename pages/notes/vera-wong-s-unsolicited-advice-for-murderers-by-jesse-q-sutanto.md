Second book I read by Jesse Q. Sutanto, after [Dial A for Aunties](/notes/dial-a-for-aunties-by-jesse-q-sutanto/) [a few weeks ago](/notes/weeknote-23-heatwave-harvest/).

Thw two were actually pretty similar: themes of family and belonging on a backdrop of a murder-comedy plot. A light and wholesome read for when [R. F. Kuang](/notes/the-dragon-republic-by-r-f-kuang/) got too dark.

6/10
