_Week 12 (20–26 March 2023)_

Let's do bullet points this week:

- Forgot to mention [last time](/notes/weeknote-3-draining-a-well/): C and I took part in a **bouldering competition** organized at our club on 18.3.23! Very friendly as usual for climbing comps, the main difference with _Get High_ in Berlin last year being that it was a club-only thing, so a lot of people knew each other, we all brought food for lunch, V who just started to make beer in Rocles had brought the said beer. I'm also pretty happy with what I climbed: 4 out of 6 purples (which is normally a red-gray at BK in Berlin, but for the competition they were more red-red)
- ...as a result we **climbed less** last week: finger skin needs to recover. Wanted to climb outdoors on the weekend but it rained. We did finally manage to see a doctor to get medical clearance for climbing, mandatory for members of the FFME (French mountaineering and climbing association, clubs like ours are registered with it and so must we)
- A nice **hike above Montpezat**! (Part of [this one](https://carte.destination-parc-monts-ardeche.fr/trek/6672-A-la-decouverte-de-Montpezat-sous-Bauzon,-Chalias), up to the hilltop viewpoint and back.) C thought we'd been there before. I was certain we hadn't. Back home we dug into old journals[^1]: we did the exact same hike on July 28th, 2017.
- Market update: **radish**!
- Garden update: ripping **ivy** off of fruit trees (using a screwdriver, pruning shears, and patience. It's easier on fig trees—smooth bark—than on plum trees—rough bark). Lots and lots of flowering trees, plum and almond trees are ash-white (love these), peach trees are pink.
- Admin update (I know you want it): the bank account is finally open! ...but we can't access the e-banking. They sent an account number by mail, then a password also by mail a few days later. I thought this was it, but when I tried to log in, I had to enable 2FA... and the activation code will come by mail, in a few days. Received my first ever **checkbook** though, which I'm pretty excited to use
- We joined the association that my grandparents helped run for ages, **Clair d'étoiles et Brin d'jardin**, focused on promoting amateur astronomy in the region. There was a general assembly where the aging active association members (which I now consider myself a part of) sailed through accounting, and then had a nice potluck dinner. Naturally I'm going to help with the ancient [website](https://clairdetoiles-brindjardin.info/), which still works pretty reliably considering that nobody really cared for it for years (decades?). [WordPress is cool](/notes/wordpress-a-new-hope/).
- In the news: [violence during protests](https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/environnement/anti-bassines-plus-de-6-000-personnes-rassemblees-dans-les-deux-sevres-2819800) in the Deux-Sèvres department[^2]. Didn't really follow it and I have mixed feelings, but mostly just sadness that it went this far, confusion too. Thoughts for T.

## Watching

I wrote a bit more about what I watched this week (instead of just [logging it](/watching/)), so this will be short. Just links:

- [10 shorts from La Fête du Court](/notes/10-shorts-from-la-fete-du-court/)
- [**Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre** (2023) by Guy Ritchie](/notes/operation-fortune-by-guy-ritchie/)
- [**Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot** (1953) by Jacques Tati](/notes/les-vacances-de-monsieur-hulot-by-jacques-tati/)

There are now [11 notes about films](/notes/?category=films) on here!

## Reading

Not really.

[^1]: a bit cringy but oh the memories! I absolutely ought to start journaling again (I guess these weeknotes are a little bit similar but no, they're filtered for online publishing. French term for journal is "carnet intime", it has "intimate" in it and that's the whole point)
[^2]: first time I heard of it. 79.
