- monorepos (cf. turborepo), remote caching etc.
- next.js: move away from jamstack because the reborn static websites new require a complex hosting system (vercel)
- tooling in rust/go (esbuild, next.js, turborepo, vite (uses esbuild) etc)
- react concurrent mode etc
- solves the wrong problem: our websites are too big
- makes sense for huge enterprise apps like facebook, not for 99% of personal websites/small products
- forces hobby devs to learn about this
