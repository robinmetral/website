- 2008 crisis
  - bonds from thousands of mortgages
  - perceived as stable
  - bought by pension funds etc.
  - good for banks issuing both mortgages and bonds (two returns)
  - bonds start having higher returns than the actual mortgages
    - bond has higher value when it hits the market (incentivizes creating more bonds)
    - limited number of houses in the US, there's a ceiling o the market
  - incentives:
    - more houses = good (more mortgages)
    - more mortgages = good (more bonds) ("a bad mortgage is worth more as part of a bond than a good mortgage that's not part of a bond")
  - --> easy to get funding from banks to build houses
  - --> easy to get mortgages from banks to buy houses
  - --> houses bought by speculators (synthetic demand, illusion that value is going up)
  - "sold a house to get a mortgage to put into a bond to sell to a pension fund to make a line go up, because it's good when the line goes up: it's a bubble"
  - bubble burst: teaser rate for mortgages expires, monthly cost goes up, speculators would want to sell the house then, but there's no buyers (synthetic demand). Stocks are dumped = price goes down. Still no buyers, but now house costs are down but mortgage costs are still the originals (high). Buyers/speculators default on their payments (can't pay) --> bonds fail
  - pension funds, savings funds etc. start failing
  - economy collapse (side effects)
  - so:
    - banks issuing mortgages were the same banks that sold the bonds and provided capital to build houses that provided mortgages
    - ratings companies (rated bonds AAA) were in relationships with banks and incentivized to keep their client happy
    - decision makers knew they could count on bailouts from the gov because they were too big to fail
- bitcoin
  - 2008 frustration with centralized gov/financial institutions. two groups:
    - anarcho-capitalists: system was too regulated (crash wouldn't have happened if there was less gov, more incentive to call foulâ€”but plenty of people profited from the foul itself = were incentivized not to call it)
    - anti-capitalist: system inherently corrupt
  - 2009: bitcoin
    - philosophically: end to banks/centralized currency. Removes gatekeepers
    - digital wallet works like a bank account
    - no need for a bank to process a tx because crypto coins are the actual money (not a representation)
    - money not issues by a gov = resistant to crises like hyperinflation from gov devaluing currency
    - flexibility of cash to the digital realm (trade without intermediaries)
  - didn't turn out like that
    - BC was slow and expensive: cannot handle regular commerce
    - mostly speculation material
    - only viable market: buy/sell prohibited drugs (high fees and multi-hour tx mitigated by receiving LSD in the mail)
    - never solved 99% of problems in the banking industry
      - still centralized, e.g. opensea, coinbase
      - changing of the guards: old money jumped onto crypto early
      - largest crypto holders are investment banks that created the subprime crash
      - new playground for smoke vendors
      - real problems are human: "what people are doing to others, not that the building they're doing it in has the word BANK on the outside"
    - other drawbacks
      - distributed, append-only ledger: **blockchain**
      - competition over who adds the next node (validator nodes): **proof of work**
      - proof of work
        - deterrent to misbehavior (email spamming example)
        - when tx are ready to be recorded, all validators compete to solve a cryptographic problem (mine)
        - more complex problems the more the network has processing power (diminishing returns) (to avoid someone building a better computer and taking over)
          - new problems: escalating processing costs: rewards capital holders (money to process). Diminishing returns are still returns
    - instead of dismantling power structure, became a new tool for existing wealth
    - energy
      - energy consumption of the Netherlands
      - critique: global banking also consumed energy
        - yes, but orders of magnitude less by tx
        - global banking is for 7bn people, not a few hundred thousand gambling addicts
      - electrical waste is the value that underpins bitcoin
        - miners spend X$ in electricity to mine a bitcoin
        - expect to sell that coin for X$+profit
        - when new power comes online (e.g. green energy), they don't let X go down, they build a bigger machine
