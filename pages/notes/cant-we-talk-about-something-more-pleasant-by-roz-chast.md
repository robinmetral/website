A very personal graphic novel by Roz Chast about her relationship to her parents as they entered old age, and until the unavoidable conclusion. Darkly funny, intimate, touching, an uncommon look into someone else's world and thoughts. I thought it would have gone deeper into the topic of how we talk about death, but this didn't really happen due to the nature of the author's relationship to her parents. Overall a hefty theme but still an enjoyable read with a certain lightness to it.

8/10
