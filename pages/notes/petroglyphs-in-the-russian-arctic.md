Recently watched: [Compartment No. 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartment_No._6) by Finnish director Juho Kuosmanen, who [described it](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/10/compartment-no-6-review-bittersweet-brief-encounter-on-an-arctic-bound-train) as _"an Arctic road movie that takes place in a train"_.

![Still from the film: Laura and Ljoha sitting side by side in a train compartment](/static/images/2022-05-01-compartment-no-6.webp)

In a nutshell (and without spoilers), the film follows Laura, a Finnish student of archaeology, as she travels by train from Moscow to Murmansk to see petroglyphs, a.k.a. ancient rock carvings. As she enters compartment number 6, she meets Ljoha, a young Russian man on his way to Murmansk to work in a coal mine. He's drunk, aggressively impolite, and will be her travel companion for the 2000 km, 35 h journey.

Something I can say—still without spoilers—is a bit more about these rock carvings. The storyline uses petroglyphs as a sort of leitmotif, but this plot thread is never quite resolved.[^1]

The Kanozero petroglyphs are about 1300 symbols that were found carved on an island on lake Kanozero. They date back to the 2nd and 3rd millennium BC but were discovered only in 1997; have a [very succinct Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanozero_Petroglyphs); and the island that they're on is not mapped on Google Maps (though you can [see it in Google satellite imagery](https://www.google.com/maps/@67.0758344,34.0950796,1824m/data=!3m1!1e3)). In other words: they're not exactly on the beaten path.

The best thing I've found about the petroglyphs is a website called _Kandalaksha+_. Here's its tagline:

> The City of Kandalaksha, Murmansk oblast, and its vicinity. Getting there, where to stay, what to do. The ultimate source of Kandalaksha and area info in English.

Kandalaksha ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandalaksha), [map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/6332097)) is a city near(ish) the petroglyphs, at the southwestern edge of the Kola peninsula ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Peninsula), [map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/5868101)).[^2]

The website's author—who goes by the name _Uncle Pasha_—is from Moscow, but studied and lived in Canada for years, which explains the focus on English-language information. Since coming back to Russia and settling in Kandalaksha, he's been providing [services](https://web.archive.org/web/20210120152437/https://kandalaksha.su/services/) to (the rare?) travelers in the region.

_Kandalaksha+_ is a wonderful mix of stories, travel tips, local news, and rants. It's funny and personal. There's [a few posts about the petroglyphs](https://web.archive.org/web/20210517125215/https://kandalaksha.su/category/south-kola/kanozero/), including one [announcing new petroglyph souvenir mugs](https://web.archive.org/web/20210302194415/https://kandalaksha.su/new-souvenirs-with-kanozeros-petroglyphs/) at a local gift shop.

Sadly, a post from January announced that Uncle Pasha died in late December last year.

I wish I could have met Pasha. I love how passionate he seemed about Kandalaksha, and that he was [offering to help visitors](https://web.archive.org/web/20210128043424/https://kandalaksha.su/free-for-asking-2/) _"ENTIRELY FREE AS A PUBLIC SERVICE"_.[^3] He would have been the perfect guide to see the petroglyphs and explore the rest of the region.

Laura, the Finnish student sleeping in Compartment No. 6, could also have used an Uncle Pasha.

She would have known to stop in Kandalaksha, not in Murmansk, and avoided a few extra hours on the train. From there, she could have taken the twice-daily bus to [Umba](https://web.archive.org/web/20210509204234/https://kandalaksha.su/umba/), the closest town to the petroglyphs.

But she didn't.

You'll have to watch the film if you want to know if she ever made it to Lake Kanozero—and what happened with Ljoha!

Here they are:

[^1]: Or sort of, but I probably shouldn't say any more in here.
[^2]: Murmansk is at the northwestern edge of the peninsula. The peninsula is about the size of South Korea. Russia is big.
[^3]: I'll do this some day.
