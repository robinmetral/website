_Week 48 (27 November–3 December 2023)_

It's cold and birds are back. (They've never left, but now they're back on the terrace where they know they'll be fed seeds.)

In French: rougequeue, rouge-gorge, mésange charbonnière et bleue, chardonneret, pinson. F also saw some verdiers.

Back in Geneva for a couple of days, went by direct TER train from Valence (1h30 drive plus 3h train). Rainy, bought cheese.

On the way back we spent the afternoon in Valence, first time in the city center ([last time](/notes/weeknote-8-les-branches/) we stuck to the Valence area). Had [great Indonesian food](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WWPK4D6tSVzBaSKV8) (don't be fooled by the lousy name), saw a [beautiful film](/notes/perfect-days-by-wim-wenders/), bought a delicious [pogne](https://www.tasteatlas.com/pogne) (a local orange blossom-flavored brioche).

In the evening we went to Mineral Spirit for the [French bouldering finals](https://www.mineral-spirit.fr/coupe-de-france-2023). We didn't see Oriane Bertone because she's already qualified for the Olympics, but there was Lily Abriat, Léo Favot and other very good French climbers ([results are in](https://mycompet.ffme.fr/resultat/resultat_11989#P21588)).

First fondue of the season with N.
