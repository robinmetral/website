Wow what a long note name. Suitable for a long film—[the longest American animated film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest_animated_films) there is at 140 min (still a far cry from the longest animated film period, Japan's 168 min _In This Corner (and Other Corners) of the World_).

A long film with such an incredible variety of styles that the amount of work that must have gone into it is hard to imagine. In fact it might be a bit _too much_ work, with [animators denouncing poor working conditions](https://www.vulture.com/2023/06/spider-verse-animation-four-artists-on-making-the-sequel.html).

But! The film is a great watch, impossible not to be amazed at the animation. Less novelty than in _Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse_ (2018) but I'd watch a lot more of this before it starts wearing me out.

_Across_ would be a solid 8 for me (with _Into_ being a 9) if not for its ending. I didn't expect the massive but poorly executed (in my opinion) cliffhanger—frustrating. One of the directors said it was like in _The Empire Strikes Back_ (Star Wars Episode V, considered one of the best sequels of all time and a pioneer of cliffhanger endings), but it made me think of _Harry Potter 7 part 1_ instead. Cutting a long film into two doesn't make for a good cliffhanger: it's a sloppy, annoying, unsatisfying ending, especially when it's clear that the next film won't come out any time soon (the next Spider-Man movie, _Beyond_, is undergoing production issues). Anyway rant over this is a 6.

6/10
