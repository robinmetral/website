Dynomight on [why countries win Olympic medals](https://dynomight.net/olympics/):

> Medal counts are not a measure of a country’s worth. Mostly, they measure (a) population, (b) economic development, and (c) how much money you’re willing to set on fire to make numbers go up on a magic billboard.

(The whole discussion on whether countries that host the Olympics win more medals is also interesting.)
