Still among the Marvel things I like the most these days, though I felt season 2 wasn't as well plotted or funny as season 1[^1]. It's darker and more serious: season 1 was all "what is happening wow retrofuturism oh there's crocodile Loki" while season 2 is more like "the multiverse is collapsing can we save it". And if you stop and think for a minute, the plot is kind of confusing and nonsensical, so the season 1 "whatever let's make this fun" strategy worked better than season 2's attempt at making it make sense. I kind of hope they don't make a season 3, it feels like it can only go downhill from here.

6/10

[^1]: season 1 was an 8/10 for me I think: it was taking itself less seriously than other MCU stuff, with great aesthetics
