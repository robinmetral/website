_Four Weddings and a Funeral_ (Mike Newell, 1994) is [streaming on MUBI FR](https://mubi.com/en/fr/films/four-weddings-and-a-funeral) right now. We wanted something light that we could watch while cracking walnuts and it was perfect (it's walnut season).

Seen before (it's a 1994 classic) but C and F hadn't, it's clich√© and cute. Your typical British Hugh-Grant-in-a-rom-com film.

6/10
