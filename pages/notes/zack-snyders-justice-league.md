Missed _Justice League_ when it came out back in 2017, which I guess makes sense since it was so badly received. Then in 2021 the co-director of the original film Zack Snyder (who had to leave the production midway through) released his own cut of the film, after fans asked for it via 180'000 signatures on a petition and _#ReleaseTheSnyderCut_. It's not really a director's cut since new footage was shot for it, but whatever. Fans thought that the original film was bad because Zack's vision for the film hadn't been honored by Joss Wheldon, who stepped in when Zack left. OF COURSE if Zack had been directing the whole thing it would be SO GOOD.

Well he did, and the result is a 4-hour film (yes, 4 full hours, the original film lasted only 2) that is... not good. Again I haven't seen the original so I can't compare the two, but isn't that beside the point? I feel that the poor reception of DC films has less to do with the directing than with the quality of the source material. Maybe DC comics just aren't that great? I mean, Darkseid[^1], honestly? Fake laughed out loud. Each of the central characters is unrelatable at best, cringy and frustrating at worst. The plot tries hard to be dark and deep but overall it's just predictable and kind of stupid.

Anyway, this passed the time, which was what I wanted out of the film. I don't have anything good to say about it except "it was not unwatchable". I think this marks the end of the last couple weeks' dumb-film-phase.

2/10
