A man emerges from the desert, scrubby and mute, four years after he disappeared without a word. As he gets his life back on track and tries to reunite with his family, we start to learn about the reasons he left.

This was the first film I saw (I think?) by acclaimed _New German Cinema_ director Wim Wenders. _Paris, Texas_ won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1984. The film spent months and months on my watchlist, and I'm ashamed that this long-overdue watch was only motivated by the fact that MUBI was taking the film off of its catalog.

I loved the contrast between the gentle pacing and the violence of some of the story. Beautiful shots and photography (the colors! High contrast low saturation on a bright decor esp. in the final scenes, wonderful). The whole thing felt free, light, real. A pleasure to watch!
