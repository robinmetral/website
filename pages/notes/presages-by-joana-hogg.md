Joana Hogg (dir. [The Souvenir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Souvenir), [The Souvenir Part II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Souvenir_Part_II), [The Eternal Daughter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eternal_Daughter), etc.[^1]) spends a winter in Los Angeles and films her surroundings. In a voice-over she talks about wanting to make a film about modern LA.

This short (2023, 10 min) is very abstract so it's difficult to say much about it, but here are a couple quick thoughts:

- it's dark!
- shots of LA at dusk in the wind and rain. It's dusk and stormy right now in Joux, so at one point I wasn't sure if the thunder was coming from my headphones or from outside
- the cemetery-in-the-snow shot is amazing. Very subtle and I loved what it doesn't show (gravestones). Lots of creative shots in geneal
- "It's <span lang="fr">_déformation professionnelle_</span>: my profession is to look for drama, and there's been a lot of drama around"

Stream it on the [Centre Pompidou's website](https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/ressources/media/1Sa92I4) (they're the producers).
