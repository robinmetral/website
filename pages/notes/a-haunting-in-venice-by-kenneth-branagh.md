Seen last night at the movies in Aubenas. It was darker/scarier than director Kenneth Branagh's (_BRAN-É™_, you're welcome) first two Agatha Christie adaptations (_Murder on the Orient Express_ (2017), _Death on the Nile_ (2022)), defs preferred it to the latter. Might have gone a bit overboard with the plot. Good start to Halloween film season

6/10
