[_Pygmy Love Song_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ3h55yAYdI), by Cameroonian musician Francis Bebey, has been stuck in my head for days. First heard on an episode of the second season of _Our Flag Means Death_ (it's [season 2 season](/notes/season-2-season/)).

Other recent earworms:

- [_Out of Time Man_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_Ywg7UtXaA), Mano Negra (heard the cover by Mick Harvey on the radio so went back to listen to the original)
- [_Sultans of Swing_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pa9x9fZBtY) (Alchemy live version), Dire Straits (found the record at the market)
- [_Panique_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVPcvTZAmSA), Juniore (and really all of Juniore's album [_Ouh là là_](https://heyjuniore.bandcamp.com/album/ouh-l-l), excellent last.fm algorithm rec)
- [_Sacatela_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZE5B0k1dMk&t=489s), La Femme (single from their latest album, stuck in my head for a whole two months in December-January)

## Bonus notes on _Pygmy Love Song_

Like a lot of Bebey's music, _Pygmy Love Song_ is played on a Pygmy flute, a single-note flute that the pygmies of the Central African Republic carved from a papaya stem ([says Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmy_music#Hindewhu)).

The musician plays it by "responding" to the flute, so the tune is more interesting than a single repeated note. The technique is called "hindewhu" and Bebey demonstrates it in [this short interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6T6suvnhco).

Herbie Hancock and percussionist Bill Summers were also struck by hindewhu when they heard it on an album of pygmy music recordings. They ended up using it in the intro of Hancock's [1973 version of _Watermelon Man_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppJQKfqhFfE). You can see Summers play hindewhu on the performance of [_Watermelon Man_ at the 1998 Montreux Jazz festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSSdLHz4kvk) ([1:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSSdLHz4kvk&t=107)). Spoiler: he's not using a flute.
