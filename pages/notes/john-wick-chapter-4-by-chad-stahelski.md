After (re)watching the first three in January this year, we had to give this one a try.

I still think that the writers did a good job with the John Wick universe (organized assassin underworld) and that actions sequences (a.k.a. most of the film) are well-made[^1], but after the fourth installment, I'm getting a little bit tired of it (and also it's almost three hours long).

5/10

[^1]: and I think that action sequence choreography and directing is exactly why the film was so well received by critics overall
