As much as I was surprised—in a good way—with the original [Creed](/notes/creed-by-ryan-coogler/), this disappointed. Maybe I should have expected it: Creed II is the sequel of a reboot. The Rocky franchise probably only works because there's enough years between each film to give people time to forget.

P.S. it's easy to ignore/forgive the cringy eastern bloc stereotypes in 1985 [Rocky IV](/notes/rocky-iv-by-sylvester-stallone/), but not so much in 2018. -1
