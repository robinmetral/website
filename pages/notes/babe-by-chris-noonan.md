A short-and-sweet animals-that-speak children (?) film by Chris Nolan if his name were misspelled.

C first saw this when she was 5 or so and has been insisting that we watch it together for the past year or so. So earlier this afternoon while petting a cute 7-month old piglet we decided to watch _Babe_ in the evening.

It's nice and there's a good amount of Animal Farm in there, until it gets all cheesy, I guess it's a children film after all.

I have questions:

- how did this get 7 Oscar nominations including Best Picture?
- how did it win one?
- how did this get a sequel?

Probable answer: piglet and puppies.

5/10
