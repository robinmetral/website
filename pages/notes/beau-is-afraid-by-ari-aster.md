Alright here we go: _Beau Is Afraid_ (dir. Ari Aster, 2023. Watched at _Wolf Kino_ in Berlin) was very, very different from Ari Aster's first two feature films. _Hereditary_ and _Midsommar_ were both very good and very scary, and even though they had surreal elements (think Toni Collette on the ceiling) they felt kind of real, or anchored in reality, overall. _Beau Is Afraid_ opens on a kind of postapocalyptic version of New York and only becomes more surreal during its 3-hour running time. It gets so far-fetched that is turns some of the horror into a kind of what-am-I-looking-at comedy. I was sort of expecting it from skimming through [David Ehrlich's review](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/beau-is-afraid-review-ari-aster-1234827032/) a few months ago, but nothing could have fully prepared me for this: it makes _Everything Everywhere All At Once_ look pretty normal in comparison.

I really liked it, also liked some parts more than others (the first wild chapter in New York, the one after in eerie suburbia, the aesthetics of the animated section) but I must admit that after 3 weeks of comparatively little sleep due to having friends over and then being over at friends, I was pretty exhausted by the end and had trouble staying focused and engaged. (I do think that this is on me not the film, C didn't experience this at all and found that the three hours flew by.) I was also very confused by the end, and if you were too, I can recommend [this _Indiewire_ explainer (with Ari Aster!)](https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/beau-is-afraid-explained-ari-aster-1234827874/) and [this other take on _Den Of Geek_](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/beau-is-afraid-ending-explained-what-the-movie-means/). They help make sense of the whole thing and I can see why critics are loving the film+it's the one that Aster is the most happy with!
