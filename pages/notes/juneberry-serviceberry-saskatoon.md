These are all names of the fruit of the [amelanchier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelanchier), a small tree with edible berry-like fruits, primarily found in North America.

Just found out that there are two in the garden, and the fruits are ripening right now (I guess juneberry is the one I like the most).

They're not very sweet, similar to blackcurrant in texture and a bit plum-like in taste (but more subtle), and a great snack during garden walks (together with sour cherries, amaranth, etc.)
