Forgot how I initially found out about this mostly-forgotten 1983 travelogue by Carol Dunlop and Julio Cortazár. Back then, not knowing about the authors—for example that Cortazár is hailed as one of the core authors in the [Latin American Boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_American_Boom) along with the likes of Mario Vargas Llosa, Gabriel García Marquez and Carlos Fuentes—I was captivated by the book's premise: in May 1982, a couple embark on a 32-day journey on the _Autoroute du Soleil_, the Paris–Marseilles freeway, aboard a red Volkswagen camper van named Fafner, after the dragon in Wagner's _Der Ring des Nibelungen_. Some rules they set for themselves: they can't leave the freeway, have to visit two rest stops per day (overnighting in one), and must record detailed scientific observations about the expedition.

I immediately ordered a copy from my local bookshop, who told me when the book arrived that it had been the very last in stock from the original 1983 edition at Gallimard. This was [back in early May](/notes/weeknote-9-a-week-of-afternoons/) and since then I've been inching through the book, essentially a collection of short essays accompanied by photos and a sort of captain's log—with details ranging from what the couple eats to the orientation of Fafner when parked at a rest stop—, it reads best in fragments.

I finished the book earlier this month, 41 years after Dunlop and Cortazár landed in Marseilles. As expected I loved it: the book is at once poetic and silly, romantic, funny, philosophical, experimental, and full of childlike wonder and curiosity. It's what traveling should be like.

10/10
