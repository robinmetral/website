I read [_Woke Racism_ by John McWorther](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/696856/woke-racism-by-john-mcwhorter/9780593423066).

After hearing McWorther speak about his book on podcasts like [Conversations with Coleman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT9qMq0faCQ) I was interested in the source material.

Too binary, some elect are surely doing useful stuff

From the vox podcast: isn't that just a feature of political fundamentalism? Religion argument is good clickbait but a bit far fetched

Main problem is that it ostracizes people otherwise friendly to the cause. They're not doing racist things, just not buying into the canceling/self censorship/fundamentalism. Risks of backfiring and antagonizing them

I felt like the book and the podcast were a bit redundant, I'd recommend choosing your medium and picking one of the two.
