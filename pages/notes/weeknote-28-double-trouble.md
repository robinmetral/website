_Week 39 (25 September–1 October 2023)_

A pretty uneventful week, reading bouldering weedwhacking having apéros. Then Sunday came.

## Double trouble

My face paralysis is getting better, I can smile again kind of. On Sunday we climbed our [third](/notes/weeknote-17-two-long-summer-weeks/) multipitch route with Z ([L'histoire du renard qui voulait savoir l'heure](https://www.camptocamp.org/routes/1472797/fr/gorges-de-l-ardeche-grand-charmasson-l-histoire-du-renard-qui-voulait-savoir-l-heure), 5c/6a/5c+/5c+), and in the third pitch I took a lead fall because a rock gave in. Bad luck, there was a sort of ledge underneath, and the result is a deep cut on my knee and a lot of difficulty moving it. We were planning 3 days of multipitch climbing in Hérault next week, but it seems like we'll have to cancel :(

## First roustide

(I'm getting a bit ahead of time here because this happened on October 2nd, but next week's weeknote will be pretty packed so I'm slipping it in here.)

We had a _roustide_ (from the Occitan _rostida_: a roast) with F Monday evening. C the neighbour brought back some chestnuts from the Montcoquiol, the first ones. Chestnut is a huge thing in Ardèche, and particularly in our area, with a bunch of different varietals and a lot of traditions. The season starts now and will last until roughly mid-November, with a peak at the end of October (when most _castagnades_ are taking place, village chestnut festivals).

We started by lighting a wood fire in the garden, chestnuts are roasted in the ember. Then we cut an X on the chestnuts (there's even a [special knife](https://media2.couteauxduchef.com/14279/couteau-chataignes-victorinox-lame-25cm-manche-bubinga.jpg) for this, but F couldn't find hers), and tossed them in a [chestnut pan](https://cdn4.tompress.com/I-Autre-28183_739x739-poeles-a-chataignes-28-cm-a-long-manche-70-cm-fabriquee-en-france.net.jpg), a metal pan with holes at the bottom. The pan goes straight on the ember until chestnuts are open and cooked through.

It was delicious! And a roustide is such a joyful event—wood fire, sweaters, white wine, roasting chestnuts under the stars.

## Watching

New Wes Anderson shorts! Adapting by Roald Dahl stories! Match made in heaven. Just one note for all four:

## Reading

Unplanned interesting parallels between _Les choses_ and _Lettres de Gourgounel_, the former describing the birth of consumerism in 1960s Paris, and the latter being sort of White's response to it. More details in notes coming later!
