After [Paper Names](/notes/paper-names-by-susie-luo/), _The Dutch House_ is the second book in a row that I pick by its cover and summary on the Libby app, by adding the filters "English", "audiobook" and "available now" and sorting the results by popularity.

This one was even more promising: the book was a Pulitzer finalist, and its audiobook version was narrated by Tom Hanks.

Hanks is a fantastic narrator and he kept me completely hooked through the 10 hours and slower pace than books I typically listen to when cooking/gardening etc (without pacing in audiobooks I tend to get distracted).

I really liked the story, yet another family drama set over an extended period of time, in this case some 50 years and three generations. It's about family of course, particularly siblinghood (is this a word). I loved the backdrop of the Dutch House, a family manor and character in its own right, that towers over the family (hi)story in good times and in bad. The writing was also great (and so was the Tom Hanks), I highly recommend it.

8/10
