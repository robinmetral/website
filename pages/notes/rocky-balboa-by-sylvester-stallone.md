a.k.a. Rocky VI. I guess Stallone named this after his character's full name because it gives it a bit of a biographical vibe, which fits, in a sense. In episode VI Rocky is in his 60s and doesn't fight anymore, his wife Adrian passed away, and he operates a small restaurant where he tells guests boxing stories. Events (involving an old-school computer simulation) bring him back into the ring for an exhibition fight. Most of the plot looks back at the previous films rather than forward, there's a lot of "remember that?" moments, and it feels as if Stallone intended this to be a finale (turns out the franchise would continue, though under a different name, with _Creed_).

It's not bad, Rocky as a character is likeable again. Bonus point for the home videos of people running up the Rocky steps during the credits.

5/10
