[Centenarian film](/notes/watching-centenarian-films/). A "thrill picture", as they called it when it came out back in 1923. There's no special effects, so Harold Lloyd climbing the exterior of a 12-story building is part stunt work (from him and a "human fly" stuntman) and part [ingenious optical tricks](https://archive.org/details/photoplayvolume22425chic/page/33/mode/1up?view=theater) (a fake building fa√ßade erected on top of buildings of various heights in Los Angeles, but the viewer doesn't notice the background changing, only the height). The climbing sequences made me feel a bit like when I saw [Free Solo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Solo), sweaty palms. Maybe _Safety Last!_ is the first climbing film. The first part of the film is slapstick comedy in the vein of Chaplin.

_Safety Last!_ is in the public domain and you can watch it [on Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Safety_Last_(1923).webm>) (silent) or [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-XZWZVVhvQ) (with Carl Davis' orchestra score).

_Note: Harold Lloyd didn't direct the film, the directors are Fred C. Newmeyer and Sam Taylor. But this is best described as a Harold Lloyd film so I'm making an exception in the name of this note._
