Third and last installment of the original Indiana Jones trilogy from the 1980s. After some criticism of [Temple of Doom](/notes/indiana-jones-and-the-temple-of-doom-by-steven-spielberg/) (too violent, mostly) Spielberg circled back to Nazis and to Egypt, like in [Raiders of the Lost Ark](/notes/raiders-of-the-lost-ark-by-steven-spielberg/). You don't change a winning team.

If it wasn't a lot of what we'd seen already in Raiders (so no bonus point for novelty), this would have been a solid 7/10 for me. It's a bit less cringy than the two first films (see previous notes), it leans more into the comedic side of things, and Sean Connery.

6/10
