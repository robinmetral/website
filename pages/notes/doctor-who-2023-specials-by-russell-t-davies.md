Doctor Who to me is another 2020 lockdown watch[^1], we watched basically all of seasons 1 to 12 (of the 2005 revival) and have been watching the new seasons as they were released since then.

It's nice to see David Tennant, the Tenth Doctor, back in the 2023 specials, which makes him also the Fourteenth Doctor. The specials are three hour-long episodes released in November and December, and while they kind of follow season 13 and anticipate season 14, they're really an isolated thing. There are some unresolved things that I'm guessing will be solved in the 2023 Christmas special.

A minor grudge I have against the show is their portrayal of feminism and LGBTQ+ topics. The series has been doing more of this since Jodie Whittaker (Thirteenth Doctor). Just tell the story and embrace it—why do you have to insist so much? Just feels awkward and forced and cheap.

Besides this, an okay plot, not my favorite Doctor Who stuff but not the worst either. I really liked [this Doctor Who short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfLtAdSgWPQ) (YouTube, 5 min) that was released a few days before the first special and acts as a sort of trailer.

5/10
