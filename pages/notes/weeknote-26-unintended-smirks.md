_Week 37 (11–17 September 2023)_

Half a year of weeknotes! I'm liking them so far—they're a good way to keep some sort of track of what's going on week after week, and to give my dad reading material (coucou papa).

## Maybe not an <em lang="fr">épisode cévenol</em>

This week C is back from Switzerland. F is still on holiday so I'm still on garden-watering, cat-feeding, mail-getting, bread-ordering and wasp-nest-busting duty. There's been less garden-watering needed because it's finally been properly raining. At time of writing (Monday 18) we're actually in the middle of a legit rainstorm, the biggest since we arrived here in January. Is this what locals call an <em lang="fr">épisode cévenol</em>? We're told that these come with intense flooding and the odd casualties at campgrounds, so maybe that's not quite as strong. Apparently they're not as common as they used to be.

## Unintended smirks

So [last week](/notes/weeknote-25-home-alone/) I wrote that I'd had some sort of ear infection. Well this week it turned into a form of partial paralysis called Bell's palsy. Basically I can't move the left side of my face—great. The upside is that it isn't painful (besides the headache), and that it should be going away in a few weeks. In the meantime it just makes it really hard to speak, eat, drink, and anything else that your face does (a lot, turns out). I constantly pour coffee on myself when I drink, can't close my left eye properly so it gets very dry, and my smiles look like weird smirks. I can still climb (sent my 5th purple route since our gym reopened!), if I'm willing to put up with B imitating my facial expressions. Generally would like this gone asap thanks!

## Watching

We started a new TV show: **Tokyo Vice**. It's from last year and I'd heard good things about it (forgot where), and when I noticed that Michael Mann—who made [Heat](/notes/heat-by-michael-mann/) that I watched [last week](/notes/weeknote-25-home-alone/)—directed the first episode, I decided to give it a go. We're only a couple of episodes in but it's pretty good so far!

## Reading

Finished two audiobooks that I started [last week](/notes/weeknote-25-home-alone/):

- [**The Dragon Republic** (2019) by R. F. Kuang](/notes/the-dragon-republic-by-r-f-kuang/) 5/10
- [**Vera Wong's Unsolicited Advice for Murderers** (2023) by Jesse Q. Sutanto](/notes/vera-wong-s-unsolicited-advice-for-murderers-by-jesse-q-sutanto/) 6/10

C and I also stumbled upon a tiny secondhand bookstore in Largentière, with mostly very old 1€ books. I got two books: Camus' classic <span lang="fr">_L'étranger_</span> (1942) that I've been [meaning to re-read](/notes/l-exil-et-le-royaume-by-albert-camus/), and Laurent Binet's newer _HHhH_ (2010) that I'd heard of somewhere and that I've already started reading.
