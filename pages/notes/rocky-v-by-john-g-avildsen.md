John G. Avildsen is back in the director's seat after Stallone took over for films II to IV.

This wasn't as bad as [the previous film](/notes/rocky-iv-by-sylvester-stallone/) but the bar was pretty low. Plot was a bit more original than in films II to IV though not outstanding and a bit awkward (trying to make this more than just a boxing films). Also really not credible, but that's true for all Rocky films so I won't hold it against V.

III/10
