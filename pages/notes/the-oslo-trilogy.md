Recently watched films by Norwegian director Joachim Trier because his last feature, [_The Worst Person in the World_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Worst_Person_in_the_World_(film)>) is out in cinemas[^1].

Protagonist Philipp is pictured wearing a white shirt on the bus, among other passengers. He is looking slightly down and to the side, not straight at the camera, and seems lost in thought." />

Both [_Reprise_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprise_(film)>) (2006) and [_Oslo, August 31st_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo,_August_31st) (2011) are streaming on MUBI. _The Worst Person in the World_ (2022) completes the so-called "Oslo trilogy".

While the films aren't actually a trilogy, they're all set in (surprise!) Oslo, and could be described as character studies on how people deal with unmet expectations and/or difficult situations (mental illness, drugs). But despite the sometimes difficult themes, the films feel surprisingly light, touching. They're both mundane and gripping. They feel human.

Warmly recommended!

Lots of fun details about the film, but also spoilers: read after watching.
