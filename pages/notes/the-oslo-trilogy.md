Recently watched films by Norwegian director Joachim Trier because his last feature, [_The Worst Person in the World_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Worst_Person_in_the_World_(film)>) is out in cinemas[^1].

Both [_Reprise_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprise_(film)>) (2006) and [_Oslo, August 31st_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo,_August_31st) (2011) are streaming on MUBI. _The Worst Person in the World_ (2022) completes the so-called "Oslo trilogy".

While the films aren't actually a trilogy, they're all set in (surprise!) Oslo, and could be described as character studies on how people deal with unmet expectations and/or difficult situations (mental illness, drugs). But despite the sometimes difficult themes, the films feel surprisingly light, touching. They're both mundane and gripping. They feel human.

Warmly recommended!
