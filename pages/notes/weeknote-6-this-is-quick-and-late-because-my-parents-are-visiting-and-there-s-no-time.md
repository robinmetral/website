_Week 14 (3–9 April 2023)_

As bullet points again, so this doesn't end up published next week:

- Garden: planted salads in the greenhouse. Removed ivy from a bunch of plum trees that now sprang out from where F threw out a bucket of moldy plums 30 years ago
- Bouldering: Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Finished a purple project (purple = hard red in most Berlin gyms)
- Parents are visiting for Easter holidays. Lots of <span lang="fr">apéros</span>, lots of food. It's really hard to plan groceries (suddenly we eat 2-3x more bread, cheese, fortunately there's still enough wine in the cellar)
- Galettes all together at _Le Colibri_ in Joyeuses, been a while I was telling F about it (_Le Colibri_ is our post-bouldering spot, when open on Friday evenings)
- K drove here for the weekend too!
- Hike to Loubaresse from above Valgorge (44.59523, 4.09170), a part of the [_Sentier des gardes_ (PDF)](https://loubaresse.fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2022/03/le-sentier-des-gardes.pdf). Uphill then across the hillside through pine, birch, oak woods and over many small streams, with a beautiful view on the Tanargue massif across the Beaume valley. On the drive back with F and C (the others walked), we stopped at C's luxurious garden in Le Chastanet for a visit and bought three strawberry plants that I put in a planter box on the terrace.

## Watching

Not a lot this week! Only the one film:

- [**Cinema Paradiso** (1988) by Giuseppe Tornatore](/notes/cinema-paradiso-by-giuseppe-tornatore/)

## Reading

- I almost finished **L'exil et le royaume** by Camus. I like the very last story a little than the others so I'm taking another break, but overall Albert's stuff is great, I should read all of it.
- Listened to Neil Gaiman's **Stardust** via the Libby app. It's a young adult thing (or as least I think it is?) but that makes it great for listening to during the long hours spent removing ivy.
- A couple more graphic novels from the last library haul. First, **The Encyclopedia of Early Earth** by Isabel Greenberg (read in its French translation), amazingly WTF, beautiful art, story somehow reminiscent of Avatar (The Last Airbender, not blue Sam Worthington). And second, <span lang="fr">**Balades en philosophie**</span> by Janine, which was, to be honest, a bit of a disappointment: philosophy so applied in practice that it made no sense anymore. Obviously intended for a general audience (or children??), but not actually useful to learn about philosophy or even about the philosophers it covers—I wouldn't really recommend it.
