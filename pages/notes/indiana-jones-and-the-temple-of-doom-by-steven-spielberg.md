Similar weirdness watching this in 2023 as for [the first film](/notes/raiders-of-the-lost-ark-by-steven-spielberg/), portrayal of women[^1] (even worse than in _Raiders of the Lost Ark_???) and of non-American characters (especially Chinese and Indian extras).

Somehow this still won an Oscar (best visual effects, funny in retrospect when seeing the plane explode with oh-so-obvious CGI, but this was 1984 so fair enough). I still liked watching it for its entertainment value and the shameless dark/gory plot (and because we have to, before film 5 comes out); but same as with the first movie, it's hard to just enjoy and ignore the bits that didn't age well: they're all over the film.

4/10

[^1]: interestingly Kate Capshaw reacted to some criticism of her character: "_The thing that surprised me the most was that the critics, women critics in particular, were very critical of Willie Scott, as if we were making a political statement and I was doing nothing for my sisters. I found it odd that it was an action-adventure film and we were meant to be doing message work._" Is this the difference between 1984 and 2023 audiences? These days this kind of thing would just not work, even if it were justified as "just entertainment"
