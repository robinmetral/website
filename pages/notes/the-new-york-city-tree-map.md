Behold the updated [New York City Tree Map](https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/):[^1]

- one dot on a map for each one of 859,065 NYC trees
- 273 different tree species, the most common being the [London planetree](https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/tree-map/species/66603)
- locals can [learn to care for city trees](https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/tree-map/learn), find tree care groups, report issues with trees, and even save trees to favorites
- ecological benefits of individual trees. For example, every year, [this 53-inch diameter planetree](https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/tree-map/tree/3362469) intercepts over 34,000 L stormwater; reduces CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 15,000 tons; etc.[^2]
