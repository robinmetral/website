Short and sweet animation movie by Oscar-winning Dutch animator Michaël Dudok de Wit, and produced by the legendary Studio Ghibli[^1].

The story is short and sweet, animation and score are great, toned down and minimalistic, a refreshing change from animation from bigger studios.

A bit sad to have watched this on my phone [on the way back from Sardinia](/notes/weeknote-14-part-1-via-a-turris-caralis/), the train wasn't the best environment to enjoy the slower, more intimate and deliberate pacing, style and music. Worth a rewatch along with the rest of the Studio Ghibli canon!

[^1]: side note: we're going to a concert of Studio Ghibli music next weekend in our area! Excited
