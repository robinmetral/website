The Hulk, but make it an ambitious lesbian bodybuilder who gets embroiled in the dysfunctions of a local crime family in small-town New Mexico. And while you're at it, add enough violence (that borders on body horror) to fully deserve an R rating.

How the film manages to be funny on top of all of this is beyond me. It hits just the right amount of Coen-brothers-like WTF comedy to balance out the gore.

It doesn't get more A24 than this and I loved it.

8/10
