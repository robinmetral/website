Heard about Tokyo Vice when the first season came out last year, but it came back to my attention when reading up on [Heat](/notes/heat-by-michael-mann/), because Michael Mann incidentally directed the series' first episode.

It's a good Japanese-depicted-by-Americans crime show, yakuza, police and the odd balance between the two. Wild to think it's based on a memoir (though [the veracity of events has been questioned](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/tokyo-vice-problematic-source-material-1235135828/)).

I don't know how realistic the depiction of Japanese work culture and hostess clubs is, but watching the show is somewhat of a culture shock. Same with the yakuza-police relations. Yet, surprisingly, some of the characters I relate to/understand the least are Westerners (e.g. Samantha). Maybe because while the Japanese characters seem to behave based on a completely different value set than I'm used to, at least it's consistent. Some of the Westerners' actions seem incoherent at best (or I just didn't get them).

In a similar vein I liked _Giri/Haji_ (Joe Barton, 2019) much better, though I don't really remember why because I watched it over three years ago.

6/10
