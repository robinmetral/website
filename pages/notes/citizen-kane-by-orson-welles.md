Finally saw this classic, frequently hailed as the single best film of all time and topping countless—usually American—best films lists.

I hadn't read up on it at all, so knew virtually nothing about the film before watching. The cinematography is certainly incredible, especially the play with shadows on black and white film. Overall I found it very good, but I expected to be blown away—what did I miss?

Might do some reading and rewatch at some point. [What's so good about Citizen Kane?](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20150720-whats-so-good-about-citizen-kane) on BBC Culture seems like a good start.

8/10
