Stumbled on the [Stripe Climate program](https://stripe.com/climate)[^1], but another recent Stripe launch came to mind... isn't Stripe also getting into [crypto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_cryptocurrencies)?

[It is](https://stripe.com/use-cases/crypto), and you read about both Stripe's commitment to the climate _and_ Stripe's investment in crypto on the [Stripe newsroom](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news):

I can see this kind of absurd/antithetical situation happen in government (one branch working on e.g. policy to reduce emissions while another invests in fossil fuels), but Stripe being a <5000 people company, it surely can't be as siloed/complex? How does Stripe leadership reconciliate thisâ€”what's their story here?

The question must have come up in an all-hands, I wish I was there to hear the answer.
