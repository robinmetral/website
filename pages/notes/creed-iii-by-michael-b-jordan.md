Just like Stallone took over in the director's seat in [Rocky II](/notes/rocky-ii-by-sylvester-stallone/), Jordan takes over in Creed III for his directorial debut.

This is the 9th and, at time of writing, latest film of the franchise and the first that Rocky has no part of (Stallone remains a producer). What happened to Rocky is never really explained, which is weird. The story is good though not amazing, it essentially creates a backstory for Adonis Creed and, naturally, ends in a big fight.

5/10
