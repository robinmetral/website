First Tim Burton in a while (the last I saw was Big Eyes, I think), watched with J and C.

Not terrible, but not good either, and definitely not memorable (I actually wonder whether I'd already seen it). Raunchy/dumb comedy which might have been fine, but on top of that a lot of the plot is kind of nonsensical. Plus it's missing the signature dark/creepy Tim Burton vibe. Watch something else.

2/10
