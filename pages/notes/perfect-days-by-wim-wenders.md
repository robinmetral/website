Le Navire, Valence, 16h20, theater 3 (almost full). The film opens with _House of the Rising Sun_, and before Eric Burdon starts singing, everyone in the room thinks it's _Le pénitencier_ by Johnny Hallyday (probably).

_Perfect Days_ follows the life of Hirayama, a man who cleans toilets in Tokyo, over the span of a few days (weeks?). The plot is pretty ambiguous, as in, it doesn't follow a clear narrative arc. You, the viewer, are not being told anything really (at least not anything explicit), you just get to watch and draw your own conclusions (if any). This ambiguity is part of what I loved about the movie: there are many ways to understand it, it's not a "that's a movie about X and Y"-type film.

While I can't sum up what the story is _about_, I have no trouble distilling what it _is_ in a single word: empathy. A very diverse set of characters—not commonly represented in movies—comes in and out of Hirayama's life, and even though as a viewer you won't learn much about them, they're all depicted with incredible respect and empathy. And this will make you care.

I think it's only my second Wim Wenders film (after [Paris, Texas](/notes/paris-texas-by-wim-wenders/)), although there are a lot more on my watchlist. After seeing _Perfect Days_, they've all just gone up.

_Perfect Days_ is touching and beautiful and absolutely worth a watch, 10/10 (intended film reference).

10/10
